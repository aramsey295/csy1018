Out of all the jobs the one that needed a degree was junior software developer and this was related to computing, computer science, economics, mathematics and physics when with the other jobs you needed a lot of experiences and skills to make up for it. The jobs that had the most salary was front-end developer and software developer, which are £40000 - £50000 and £30000 - £35000 and that years of experience is needed for the job when with front end engineer there is no experience needed and depended on how good you were and required a lot of responsibility. The non-technical jobs consisted of confidence, which was for web developer, proactive, creative and passionate for front-end engineer and no non-technical skills for junior software developer and showed that you don’t just need technical skills when applying for jobs. When looking at technical skills HTML, CSS, javascript is needed to code in the jobs for junior web developer and front-end engineer and the same for SQL with junior web developer and junior software developer.
