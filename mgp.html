      <h3>The Salle website was researched by myself and that it influenced us as a team with the navigation bar, links and text alignments within the website. The conventions in this website were the same as the others when it came to links because they were positioned in the exact same way. Opacity was added myself to the two bars so that it would create a more visual effect and it showed glimpses of the background image. The links underline when being hovered over which salle wbesite was the only website out of the three which showed the website has a bit more functionality. The Paravel website was researched by Matt and the conventions that were found in this website were again the navigation bar and the columns which influenced us more to put columns in our website so that it would look presentable and not same old layout. The text aswell was another and the size was suitable when it came to reading it. The last website that was researched on was the stuff and nonsense website and was done by me and Matt and just like the other websites it shared the same common aspects such as the links but everything was centered like the images and text and so we stayed with these designs throughout our websites. For my conclusion all these websites that were researched on had the same similarities with each other and made our websites exeptional.</h3>
