      <h2>Experience of learning web development </h2>
      <h3>For the first term of web development the experiences as a team we have gained are how websites work in the terms of opening web pages and searching for them and that this is linked to knowing how HTML and CSS works altogether as one.  
      We found as a team when creating the website it acquired so much knowledge on how to code in HTML to display web pages and CSS for adding the scripts to the HTML. The skills as well you need for developer jobs is interesting and gave us more of an understanding whether or not you need a degree to apply for the job, the non technical skills you’ll need because its not all down to the technical skills that have been gained and the salary you get from each developer job. When working on the website we found many examples of model of good practices to choose from and this was related to the navigation bar, the footer, images and other functions and that working in a team we discovered which models were best suited and appropriate and we found choosing the correct models made the website look best suited. 	Making the website responsive was a challenge as everything such as the navigation, boxes, images had to be compatible with the mobile phone because over 60% of users use their phones more than desktops and taking that in account was difficult. Also working with a team helped make the website look well professional and creative and that using each other’s ideas and skills made the website more enjoyable to create and be apart of. Finding out that Java script had to be used in some of the good model of practices was a challenge and required us as a team to figure out why the code wasn’t working properly and made us understand how to code it properly.</h3>
